          Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Abdul Hannan, a passionate front-end developer who loves bringing ideas to life through code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my journey in web development almost a decade ago. Since then, Iâ€™ve built websites and apps with a
          focus on clean design, performance, and user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m comfortable working with <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>,
          <strong> PHP7</strong>, and <strong>MySQL</strong>. I'm also exploring modern tools like <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Bootstrap</strong> to keep my skills sharp.
        </p>
        <p>Letâ€™s build something awesome together! ðŸš€</p>
      </div>
    </section>
